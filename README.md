# Zombie Halo

Experimenting with BLE, by means of trying to make an app that
is compatible with the SmartHalo.

The motivation is that my SmartHalo 2 is nothing more than a bike light,
now that the official app no longer works with my iPhone.

The project is written in NodeJS, simply because that's the language
I am currently using for my day job. Eventually this could be used as
part of a Capacitor app for generating an Android or iPhone target.

Any explorations of the protocol will be documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/ajmas/zombie-halo/wiki).

Let's see how this goes... hoping it won't be just another placeholder
or half baked project on GitHub.
